echo "🔧 Fixing Vitest Extension Configuration Issues..."
echo ""

echo "❌ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:"
echo "   Vitest extension v1.24.3 is incompatible with Vitest v3.2.3"
echo "   Multiple configuration errors causing constant failures"
echo ""

echo "🎯 SOLUTION APPLIED:"
echo "   ✅ Disabled Vitest extension in VS Code settings"
echo "   ✅ Extension will no longer attempt to load configs"
echo "   ✅ Tests can still run via npm scripts"
echo ""

echo "💡 WHY THIS FIXES THE ISSUE:"
echo "   • Vitest extension is optional for development"
echo "   • npm scripts work independently of the extension"
echo "   • Removes all configuration error logs"
echo "   • Proves our point about optional extensions!"
echo ""

echo "🚀 VERIFICATION:"
echo "   Tests still work: npm run test"
echo "   Coverage still works: npm run test:coverage"
echo "   Watch mode still works: npm run test:watch"
echo ""

echo "🧹 CLEANUP (optional):"
echo "   Remove backup files if fix is successful:"
echo "   rm -f vitest.config.ts.backup"
echo ""

if [ -f "vitest.config.ts.backup" ]; then
    echo "   📁 Found backup file: vitest.config.ts.backup"
    echo "   🗑️  Run: rm vitest.config.ts.backup (when ready)"
