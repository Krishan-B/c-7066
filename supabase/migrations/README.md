# Supabase Workspace Cleanup Instructions

This workspace has been cleaned of all legacy migrations, functions, and edge function folders to
avoid any future conflicts or mismatches.

## What was removed:

- All old migration files in `supabase/migrations/` (except this README)
- All files in `supabase/functions/` (edge function code)
- All files in `supabase/migrations/_archive/` (backups/skipped)

## Next Steps

- Use the Supabase Dashboard UI or CLI to create new tables, policies, and migrations as needed.
- Add new migration files only for your new, clean schema.
- If you need to restore any old logic, use version control or backups.

This ensures your Supabase workspace is ready for a fresh, error-free start.
