# Running the Development Servers

If you're having issues with the `npm run dev` command, you can run the client and server separately.

## Client Terminal

```bash
npm run dev:client
```

## Server Terminal

```bash
npm run dev:server
```

## Installing Dependencies

```bash
npm install -D concurrently tsx drizzle-orm pg @types/pg express cors dotenv @types/express @types/cors
```
