# 🎯 EXTENSION OPTIMIZATION VERIFICATION NEEDED

## 📊 Current Status Check Required

Based on the file system scan, I can see that **29 extensions** are still
present in the extensions directory, including the ones that should have been
manually uninstalled:

### 🗑️ **EXTENSIONS STILL PRESENT (Should be removed):**

- ❌ `vue.volar` (Vue.js)
- ❌ `coderabbit.coderabbit-vscode` (CodeRabbit)
- ❌ `firefox-devtools.vscode-firefox-debug` (Firefox DevTools)
- ❌ `ms-azuretools.vscode-docker` (Docker)
- ❌ `ms-azuretools.vscode-containers` (Docker Containers)
- ❌ `ms-edgedevtools.vscode-edge-devtools` (Edge DevTools)
- ❌ `ms-mssql.mssql` (SQL Server)
- ❌ `ms-mssql.data-workspace-vscode` (SQL Data Workspace)
- ❌ `ms-mssql.sql-bindings-vscode` (SQL Bindings)
- ❌ `ms-mssql.sql-database-projects-vscode` (SQL Database Projects)
- ❌ `ms-vscode.azure-repos` (Azure Repos)
- ❌ `ms-vscode.remote-repositories` (Remote Repositories)
- ❌ `github.remotehub` (Remote Hub)
- ❌ `github.codespaces` (Codespaces)
- ❌ `christian-kohler.npm-intellisense` (NPM IntelliSense)

## 🤔 **POSSIBLE REASONS:**

1. **VS Code UI vs File System Lag** - Extensions uninstalled in UI but files
   not yet cleaned up
2. **Restart Required** - VS Code needs a complete restart to remove extension
   files
3. **Partial Uninstallation** - Some extensions might not have been fully
   uninstalled

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS TO VERIFY:**

### **Option 1: Check VS Code Extensions Panel**

1. Open VS Code Extensions panel (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
2. Count how many extensions are shown as **installed** (not disabled)
3. Tell me the exact count you see

### **Option 2: Complete VS Code Restart**

1. Close VS Code completely (`Alt+F4`)
2. Wait 10 seconds
3. Reopen VS Code
4. Check Extensions panel again

### **Option 3: Force Clean Extension Cache**

1. Close VS Code completely
2. Run: `scripts\force-remove-extensions.bat`
3. Restart VS Code

## ❓ **QUESTION FOR YOU:**

**In the VS Code Extensions panel, how many extensions do you currently see as
"Installed"?**

- If you see **12-15 extensions**: ✅ Success! The optimization worked
- If you see **25+ extensions**: ❌ Need to complete the removal process

The anti-freeze settings are already applied and working (as shown in the
diagnostic), but we need to ensure the extension count is actually reduced for
maximum performance.

**Please check your Extensions panel and let me know the exact count you see
there.**
