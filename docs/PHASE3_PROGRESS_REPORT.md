# Phase 3 Migration Progress Report

## Completed Items

### Phase 3.1: Configuration Consolidation

- ✅ Created configuration directory structure (`/config/`)
- ✅ Migrated ESLint configuration files
- ✅ Migrated TypeScript configuration files
- ✅ Migrated Jest configuration files
- ✅ Migrated Vite configuration files
- ✅ Updated `package.json` scripts to use the new configuration paths
- ✅ Tested configuration changes (TypeScript compilation and ESLint)

### Phase 3.2: Frontend Organization (In Progress)

- ✅ Created detailed frontend reorganization strategy in `FRONTEND_REORGANIZATION.md`

- ✅ Created layouts directory with MainLayout component
- ✅ Started moving navigation components to their appropriate directories
- ✅ Created backup of the src directory before reorganization

## Current Focus

- Moving components to their appropriate feature directories
- Updating import paths throughout the codebase
- Ensuring components are correctly categorized

## Next Steps

1. Complete feature-based organization of components
2. Standardize layout components
3. Update import paths throughout the codebase
4. Test the reorganized frontend
5. Begin backend reorganization

## Issues and Challenges

- Managing import paths during the transition
- Ensuring all component dependencies are correctly resolved
- Maintaining backward compatibility during the migration

## Risk Mitigation

- Created comprehensive backups before starting each phase
- Testing after each major component move
- Committing changes regularly to maintain checkpoints
