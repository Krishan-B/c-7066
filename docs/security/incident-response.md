  - Significant security control bypass

#### Medium (P2)
- **Response Time**: 4 hours
- **Examples**:
  - Suspicious login patterns
  - Minor security control failures
  - Potential vulnerability exploitation
  - Security monitoring alerts

#### Low (P3)
- **Response Time**: 24 hours
- **Examples**:
  - Security policy violations
  - Failed login attempts
  - Security awareness issues

## Incident Response Process

### 1. Detection and Analysis

#### Initial Detection
- Security monitoring alerts
- User reports
- External threat intelligence
- Automated security scans
- Third-party notifications

#### Initial Assessment
1. **Triage** (5 minutes):
   - Confirm incident validity
   - Assign severity level
   - Activate incident response team

2. **Scope Assessment** (15 minutes):
   - Identify affected systems
   - Determine potential data exposure
   - Assess business impact
   - Document initial findings

#### Investigation Checklist
- [ ] Review security logs and monitoring data
- [ ] Check user authentication logs
- [ ] Examine API access patterns
- [ ] Review database access logs
- [ ] Analyze network traffic
- [ ] Check third-party service status

### 2. Containment

#### Short-term Containment
- **Immediate Actions** (within 30 minutes):
  - Isolate affected systems
  - Disable compromised accounts
  - Block malicious IP addresses
  - Revoke compromised API keys
  - Enable additional monitoring

#### Long-term Containment
- **System Hardening**:
  - Apply security patches
  - Update security configurations
  - Implement additional controls
  - Enhanced monitoring deployment

### 3. Eradication

#### Root Cause Analysis
- Identify attack vectors
- Determine system vulnerabilities
- Review security control failures
- Document exploitation methods

#### System Cleanup
- Remove malware/malicious code
- Close security vulnerabilities
- Update compromised credentials
- Patch identified weaknesses

### 4. Recovery

#### System Restoration
- Restore systems from clean backups
- Verify system integrity
- Test security controls
- Gradual service restoration

#### Monitoring Enhancement
- Implement additional monitoring
- Enhanced logging configuration
- Real-time alerting setup
- Continuous vulnerability scanning

### 5. Post-Incident Activity

#### Documentation
- Complete incident report
- Timeline reconstruction
- Impact assessment
- Cost analysis

#### Lessons Learned
- Conduct post-incident review
- Identify process improvements
- Update security procedures
- Training recommendations

## Communication Procedures

### Internal Communications

#### Immediate Notification
- Incident response team activation
- Management briefing
- Technical team coordination

#### Status Updates
- Regular team updates (every 30 minutes during active response)
- Management briefings (every 2 hours)
- Stakeholder communications

### External Communications

#### Customer Notification
- **Criteria for Notification**:
  - Personal data exposure
  - Service disruption > 4 hours
  - Account security compromise

- **Notification Timeline**:
  - Initial: Within 24 hours of confirmation
  - Updates: Every 24 hours until resolution
  - Final: Within 7 days of resolution

#### Regulatory Notification
- **GDPR**: Within 72 hours for personal data breaches
- **Financial Regulators**: As required by jurisdiction
- **Law Enforcement**: For criminal activity

#### Media Relations
- Designate single spokesperson
- Prepare factual statements
- Coordinate with legal team

## Incident Response Tools

### Technical Tools
```bash
# Log Analysis
grep -r "suspicious_pattern" /var/log/
journalctl -u service_name --since "1 hour ago"

# Network Analysis
tcpdump -i interface -w capture.pcap
netstat -tuln | grep :port

# System Analysis
ps aux | grep suspicious_process
lsof -i :port
```

### Documentation Templates
- Incident report template
- Communication templates
- Checklist templates
- Legal hold notices

## Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery
```sql
-- Backup verification
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('tradepro'));

-- Point-in-time recovery
SELECT pg_create_restore_point('before_incident');
```

### API Key Rotation
```javascript
// Emergency API key rotation
const rotateApiKeys = async () => {
  // Disable current keys
  await disableApiKeys();
  // Generate new keys
  const newKeys = await generateNewApiKeys();
  // Update configurations
  await updateApiKeyConfigs(newKeys);
  // Notify services
  await notifyServicesOfKeyRotation();
};
```
