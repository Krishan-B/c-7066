### 3.4. ✅ **Admin: KYC Review** - CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED

  - Document status fields (`status`, `reviewed_at`, `reviewed_by`) ready for Plexop updates
  - Clear separation: user-facing endpoints only in our backend
  - Comprehensive documentation for Plexop integration points

**Plexop Integration Points:**

- Database: Direct access to `kyc_documents` table for review operations
- File Storage: Access to Supabase Storage `kyc-documents` bucket
- Status Updates: Can update document status, review comments, timestamps
- User Management: Can control user KYC status affecting trading permissions

## Additional Implementation Features

### ✅ **Trading Restrictions** - BONUS FEATURE

- OrderForm component blocks trading for non-KYC users
- Clear warning messages and KYC verification prompts
- Trading permissions enforced across the platform

### ✅ **Enhanced User Experience**
