# Frontend Reorganization Progress Report

## Completed Steps

### 1. Component Migration to Feature Directories

#### Authentication (auth) Feature

- ✅ Moved `AuthContext` to `/src/features/auth/context/AuthContext.ts`
- ✅ Moved `AuthProvider` to `/src/features/auth/context/AuthProvider.tsx`
- ✅ Moved `ProtectedRoute` to `/src/features/auth/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- ✅ Created `/src/features/auth/index.ts` to re-export components

#### Trading Feature

- ✅ Moved `OrderForm` to `/src/features/trading/components/OrderForm.tsx`
- ✅ Moved `TradingViewChart` to `/src/features/trading/components/TradingViewChart.tsx`
- ✅ Created `/src/features/trading/index.ts` to re-export components

#### Market Feature

- ✅ Moved `MarketOverview` to `/src/features/market/components/MarketOverview.tsx`
- ✅ Moved `MarketStats` to `/src/features/market/components/MarketStats.tsx`
- ✅ Moved `MarketStatusIndicator` to `/src/features/market/components/MarketStatusIndicator.tsx`
- ✅ Created `/src/features/market/index.ts` to re-export components

### 2. Layout Reorganization

- ✅ Created `/src/layouts/MainLayout.tsx` based on the existing Layout component
- ✅ Created `/src/layouts/index.ts` to re-export layouts
- ✅ Updated `App.tsx` to use the new MainLayout instead of Layout

### 3. Import Path Updates

- ✅ Started updating import paths in App.tsx
- ✅ Added proper imports for new component locations

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Import Issues**: Address compile errors in the migrated components and App.tsx
2. **Complete Component Migration**: Continue moving remaining components to their appropriate
   feature directories
3. **Update Import Paths**: Update all imports throughout the codebase to use the new module paths
4. **Testing**: Test the reorganized frontend to ensure everything works correctly
5. **Documentation Update**: Update the project documentation to reflect the new structure

## Challenges and Solutions

### Import Path Resolution

- **Challenge**: Components that have been moved to new locations have import path issues
- **Solution**: We need to update the imports in all files to reference the new component locations

### Component Dependencies

- **Challenge**: Some components have dependencies on other components or utilities that also need
  to be migrated
- **Solution**: Identify component dependencies and migrate related files together

## Testing Strategy

1. Build the application to identify any remaining import issues
2. Run unit tests after each major component migration
3. Perform manual testing to verify UI components render correctly
4. Verify routing and navigation still works as expected

This report reflects our current progress in reorganizing the frontend according to the
feature-based architecture outlined in our migration plan.
