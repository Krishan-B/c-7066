# Backup Strategy for Phase 3 Migration

## Overview

This document outlines the backup strategy for Phase 3 of the Trade-Pro Workspace Cleanup &
Optimization project. The backup is designed to ensure that all critical files are preserved before
any migration or reorganization takes place.

## Backup Location

All backups are stored in the `/workspaces/Trade-Pro/backups/phase3_migration_20250701_053506/`
directory with a timestamp to uniquely identify this backup.

## Files and Directories to Backup

### Configuration Files

- All package.json files
- All *config.js and *config.ts files
- .env files (if not containing sensitive information)
- tsconfig\*.json files

### Source Code

- Complete src/ directory
- Backend API code (backend-api/ directory)
- Supabase configuration (supabase/ directory)

### Documentation

- All documentation in docs/ directory
- README.md and other markdown files at the root

### Testing

- Test files and configurations
- Jest configuration files
- Integration and unit tests

## Backup Verification

After creating the backup, verification will be performed by:

1. Comparing file counts between source and backup directories
2. Verifying the integrity of key configuration files
3. Ensuring all critical directories are included

## Restoration Procedure

In case a restoration is required:

1. Stop any running services
2. Remove or rename the current directories that need to be restored
3. Copy the backed-up directories back to their original locations
4. Restore configuration files
5. Run integration tests to verify functionality

## Backup Retention

This backup will be retained for the duration of Phase 3 and for at least one week after the
successful completion of the phase.

## Safety Measures

- No backup files will be overwritten
- A complete file manifest will be included in the backup directory
- The backup process is designed to be non-destructive to the original files
