# KYC Implementation Summary

## Overview

The KYC (Know Your Customer) system has been fully implemented for the Multi-Asset CFD Trading
Platform according to the PRD specifications. The implementation is designed to work with the
external Plexop internal management tool for document review and approval.

## Architecture

### Backend Implementation (`/backend-api/src/routes/kyc.ts`)

- **User-facing endpoints only** - No admin functionality in main platform
- **Supabase integration** - Uses Supabase Storage for document storage and PostgreSQL for metadata
- **Complete CRUD operations** for user document management

#### Available Endpoints:

- `GET /api/kyc/status` - Returns user KYC status and document list
- `POST /api/kyc/upload` - Handles document upload with validation
- `GET /api/kyc/documents` - Lists user's uploaded documents
- `DELETE /api/kyc/documents/:id` - Allows users to delete their documents
- `PUT /api/kyc/documents/:id` - Allows users to update document comments

#### Key Features:

- File validation (PDF, JPG, PNG, max 10MB)
- Automatic file naming and storage organization
- Error handling and cleanup on failures
- User authorization checks
- Document status tracking

### Frontend Implementation

#### Pages:

- **`/src/pages/KYC.tsx`** - Main KYC verification page with tabs for upload and document management

#### Components:

- **`/src/components/kyc/DocumentList.tsx`** - Display uploaded documents with status
- **`/src/components/kyc/KYCBanner.tsx`** - Dashboard notification banner
- **`/src/hooks/useKYC.ts`** - Custom hook for KYC operations

#### Key Features:

- Upload progress tracking
- Error display and handling
- Status-based UI updates
- Document categorization (ID Verification, Address Verification, Other)

### Trading Restrictions

## Plexop Integration

The external Plexop tool handles all administrative functions:

### Document Review Process:

1. **Queue Management** - Pending documents appear in Plexop queue

- Add review comments
- Track review history
- Manage user account balances
- Control trading permissions

## User Experience Flow

### New User Journey:

1. **Dashboard Banner** - Red notification: "One last step before trading"
2. **KYC Page** - Upload required documents
3. **Review Process** - Documents reviewed via Plexop (1-3 business days)
4. **Status Updates** - Email notifications for status changes
5. **Trading Access** - Full platform access after approval

### KYC Status States:

- **PENDING** - Documents uploaded, awaiting review
- **APPROVED** - All required documents approved, full trading access
- **REJECTED** - Documents rejected, user must re-upload

## Trading Restrictions
