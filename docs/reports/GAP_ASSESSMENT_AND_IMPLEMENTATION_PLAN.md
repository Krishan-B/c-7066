# Gap Assessment Report and Implementation Plan: Trade-Pro vs. PRD

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a gap assessment comparing the current state of the "Trade-Pro" project with the requirements outlined in the "Multi Asset CFD Simulated Trading Platform - Product Requirements Document" (PRD) dated June 15, 2025. It also includes a step-by-step actionable implementation plan to bridge these gaps and align the project with the PRD.

## 2. Overall Current Project Status (Summary)

The "Trade-Pro" project has undergone significant cleanup and modernization:

- Migrated from Jest to Vitest for testing.
- Resolved numerous linting and TypeScript errors.
- Standardized project structure and configuration.
- Implemented basic CI/CD workflows.
- Has foundational UI components (shadcn/ui) and structure for features like authentication, KYC, trading, and market data display.
- Utilizes Supabase for backend services (auth, database, functions).
- Frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

However, the project was developed organically and now needs to be systematically aligned with the new comprehensive PRD.

## 3. Gap Assessment

This section details the gaps identified between the PRD and the current project state.

## 4. Actionable Implementation Plan

This plan prioritizes addressing critical gaps first, followed by foundational features, and then advanced functionalities. It aligns with the PRD's phased approach where possible.

### Phase 0: Pre-requisites & Critical Alignment

1.  **Decision on UI Library:**
    - **Action:** Decide whether to migrate from shadcn/ui to Material-UI/Ant Design (as per PRD) or update the PRD to reflect shadcn/ui.
    - **Rationale:** shadcn/ui is modern and capable; migration is a large effort. Alignment is key.
    - **Timeline:** 1 week (discussion and decision).
2.  **Market Data Source Migration Planning:**
    - **Action:** Thoroughly investigate Yahoo Finance Free API capabilities, rate limits, and data availability for all required asset classes and historical data. Plan the migration from existing data sources (Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, Polygon).
    - **Rationale:** This is a critical PRD requirement impacting the core of the application.
    - **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks (research and planning).
3.  **Plexop Internal Tool - Initial Scoping & Design:**
    - **Action:** High-level design and architecture for the Plexop internal tool. Decide if it's a separate application or an admin module within the main app.
    - **Rationale:** This is a major new component critical for KYC and account management.
    - **Timeline:** 2 weeks (scoping and high-level design).
4.  **Database Schema Alignment Strategy:**
    - **Action:** Map the current Supabase schema to the PRD's SQL schema. Plan necessary migrations, new tables, and modifications.
    - **Rationale:** Ensures data structure supports all PRD features.
    - **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks.
5.  **Security Requirements - Foundational Review:**
    - **Action:** Review Supabase's default security. Plan implementation for critical items like input validation, SQL injection prevention (via ORM/Supabase client), and secure API patterns.
    - **Rationale:** Security is paramount.
    - **Timeline:** Ongoing, initial plan 1 week.

## 5. Conclusion

Significant gaps exist between the current "Trade-Pro" project and the new PRD. The most critical areas involve the market data source (Yahoo Finance), the development of the Plexop internal tool, comprehensive KYC workflow, advanced trading engine features, and detailed financial analytics. The provided implementation plan offers a phased approach to systematically address these gaps and deliver a platform aligned with the PRD's vision. Continuous review and adaptation will be necessary.
