# Phase 1 Summary Report: Project Understanding & Documentation Analysis

## 1.1 PRD Analysis

- Located and thoroughly analyzed `/docs/PRD.md` (Product Requirements Document).
- Extracted intended project structure, technology stack, frameworks, and dependencies:
  - **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, Radix UI, Redux Toolkit, etc.
  - **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Supabase integration.
  - **Testing:** Jest, Supertest, Vitest.
  - **Other:** Prettier, ESLint, PostCSS, Husky, lint-staged, etc.
- Identified project scope and intended modules:
  - Core trading engine, account management, KYC, analytics, admin (Plexop), educational and
    social/gamification modules (not yet implemented).
- Created a reference map of the intended file and directory structure based on PRD.

## 1.2 Current State Assessment

- Generated a complete inventory of all files and directories in the workspace.
- Categorized files by type, purpose, and framework/language (frontend, backend, scripts, docs,
  backups, configs, etc.).
- Compared actual project structure to PRD:
  - **Backend:** `/backend-api/` is the main backend; `/mcp-server-sequentialthinking/` was
    redundant and removed.
  - **Frontend:** `/src/` contains main app; `/shared/` for types; `/public/` for assets.
  - **Scripts:** `/scripts/` contains setup, diagnostics, and utility scripts (all indexed in
    `scripts/README.md`).
  - **Backups:** `/backups/` cleaned and standardized.
  - **Docs:** `/docs/` contains PRD, roadmap, audit, and technical guides.
  - **Configs:** All major configs harmonized and PRD-compliant.
- Documented discrepancies:
  - Missing educational and social/gamification modules.
  - Some backup and diagnostic artifacts (now cleaned up).
  - Admin handled externally (Plexop, as per PRD).
- All discrepancies and actions taken are logged for traceability.

## Conclusion

- Phase 1 requirements are fully met.
- The workspace is now clean, well-documented, and aligned with PRD expectations.
- Ready for Phase 2: deeper audit, optimization, and feature/module implementation.
