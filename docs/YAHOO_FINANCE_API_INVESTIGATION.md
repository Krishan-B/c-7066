# Yahoo Finance API Investigation for Trade-Pro Integration

Date: June 16, 2025

This document outlines the investigation into the Yahoo Finance API (leveraging the `yfinance` library where applicable as a reference for capabilities) to assess its suitability for the Trade-Pro project as per the Product Requirements Document (PRD).

## Investigation Priorities

1. **Available asset classes and depth of data for each.**
2. Historical data availability.
3. API rate limits and any associated costs.
4. Real-time data capabilities and update frequency.
5. Specific data points available beyond OHLCV.
6. Data quality and reliability.
7. Ease of integration (with `yfinance` as a potential tool).

---

## 1. Available Asset Classes and Depth of Data

**Objective:** Determine the range of asset classes supported by the Yahoo Finance API and the general depth of coverage for symbols within those classes.

**Findings (Based on general knowledge and `yfinance` library capabilities):**

Yahoo Finance is known to provide data for a wide variety of asset classes. The `yfinance` library, which interfaces with Yahoo Finance, typically allows access to:

- **Stocks/Equities:** Extensive coverage of global stock exchanges. Data usually includes major and minor exchanges. Ticker symbols are standard (e.g., `MSFT`, `AAPL`, `GOOGL`).
  - _Depth:_ Generally very good for publicly traded companies.
- **Indices:** Major global indices (e.g., S&P 500 (`^GSPC`), NASDAQ (`^IXIC`), FTSE 100 (`^FTSE`), DAX (`^GDAXI`), Nikkei 225 (`^N225`)).
  - _Depth:_ Good coverage of well-known market indices.
- **Forex (Foreign Exchange):** Major currency pairs (e.g., `EURUSD=X`, `GBPUSD=X`, `JPY=X`).
  - _Depth:_ Good coverage for major and some minor currency pairs.
- **Cryptocurrencies:** A growing selection of major cryptocurrencies (e.g., `BTC-USD`, `ETH-USD`).
  - _Depth:_ Coverage has been expanding but might not be as comprehensive as specialized crypto exchanges for all altcoins.
- **Commodities:** Futures for commodities like Gold (`GC=F`), Crude Oil (`CL=F`), Silver (`SI=F`), Natural Gas (`NG=F`).
  - _Depth:_ Good coverage for major commodity futures.
- **ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds):** Wide range of ETFs from various markets (e.g., `SPY`, `QQQ`, `GLD`).
  - _Depth:_ Very good, similar to stocks.
- **Mutual Funds:** Data on various mutual funds.
  - _Depth:_ Good coverage, particularly for larger funds.
- **Bonds/Treasuries:** Some government bond yields (e.g., US Treasury Yields like `^TNX` for 10-Year).
  - _Depth:_ More focused on benchmark yields rather than individual bond issues.

**Considerations for Trade-Pro:**

- The PRD specifies a "Multi Asset CFD Simulated Trading Platform." While Yahoo Finance provides data for the underlying assets, it does **not** directly provide CFD (Contract for Difference) pricing. The platform will need to simulate CFD pricing based on the underlying asset data, including simulating spreads, swaps, and leverage effects as outlined in the PRD.
- The `yfinance` library relies on publicly available Yahoo Finance endpoints. The exact depth and availability can sometimes change without notice, as it's not an officially supported, contractual API for heavy commercial use.
- Symbol conventions need to be mapped correctly (e.g., `^` for indices, `=X` for forex, `=F` for futures).

**Next Steps for this point:**

- Verify if the PRD lists specific, less common asset classes or symbols that need to be double-checked for availability.
- During implementation, robust error handling will be needed for cases where data for a specific symbol might be temporarily unavailable or delisted.

## 2. Historical Data Availability

**Objective:** Assess if Yahoo Finance can provide the required historical data depth (min 5 years) and timeframes (daily, intraday, weekly, monthly) for OHLCV data, as specified in the PRD.

**Findings (Based on general knowledge and `yfinance` library capabilities):**

- **Data Span (PRD Requirement: Min 5 years):**

  - For most actively traded **equities, ETFs, and major indices**, Yahoo Finance typically offers historical data extending back much further than 5 years (often 10-20+ years).
  - For **forex pairs and commodities**, extensive historical data is also generally available, meeting the 5-year requirement.
  - **Cryptocurrencies:** Historical data availability varies by coin. Newer or less common coins might have less than 5 years of history. Major ones like BTC-USD usually have data back to their significant trading history on exchanges Yahoo tracks.
  - The `yfinance` library allows fetching data for specific start/end dates or periods (e.g., `period="5y"`, `period="max"`).

- **Available Timeframes/Intervals:**

  - **Daily (`1d`):** Standard and widely available for the full historical span of an asset. This is crucial for the PRD's 5-year requirement.
  - **Weekly (`1wk`), Monthly (`1mo`):** Also available for the full historical span.
  - **Intraday:** Yahoo Finance provides intraday data, but with limitations on how far back it goes:
    - Intervals like `1m`, `2m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `60m` (`1h`), `90m` are common.
    - **Limitation:** The historical depth for intraday data is typically restricted. For example:
      - 1-minute data might only be available for the last 7 days.
      - 60-minute data might be available for the last 60-730 days (varies).
    - The `yfinance` library documentation notes that for intervals less than 1 day, the maximum lookback period is 730 days, and for 1-minute data, it's 7 days (with some data up to ~30 days if fetched carefully).

- **Data Points:**
  - **OHLCV:** Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume are standard data points for historical fetches.
  - **Adjusted Close:** `yfinance` can provide an "Adjusted Close" price, which accounts for dividends and stock splits. This is important for accurate long-term performance analysis.
  - **Splits and Dividends:** The library can also fetch information about stock splits and dividend payments separately.

**Considerations for Trade-Pro:**

- The 5-year daily historical data requirement seems well-covered for most assets.
- **Intraday Historical Data Limitation:** The limited lookback for intraday data is a significant factor. If the PRD implies extensive backtesting or analysis on _long periods_ of intraday data (e.g., 5 years of 1-minute data), Yahoo Finance (and `yfinance`) will **not** meet this directly. The platform might need to:
  - Store intraday data progressively if long-term intraday history is a strict requirement (though this adds complexity and storage costs).
  - Clarify PRD expectations around historical intraday data depth.
  - Focus on daily data for long-term analysis and use available intraday data for shorter-term views/charting.
- The PRD mentions "multiple timeframes" for historical data. Daily, weekly, and monthly are well supported for long-term analysis. Intraday is supported for recent periods.

**Next Steps for this point:**

- Confirm with stakeholders if the PRD's "min 5 years, multiple timeframes" requirement for historical data implies needing 5 years of _intraday_ data, or if 5 years of daily/weekly/monthly plus recent intraday data is sufficient.
- Plan data fetching strategies to maximize available intraday history if needed, within the API's limitations.

## 3. API Rate Limits and Associated Costs

**Objective:** Understand the rate limits imposed by the unofficial Yahoo Finance API (as accessed by libraries like `yfinance`) and determine if there are any costs associated with its usage, especially for a platform like Trade-Pro which might make a considerable number of requests.

**Findings (Based on general knowledge, `yfinance` community discussions, and typical behavior of unofficial APIs):**

- **No Official, Published Rate Limits:** Yahoo Finance does not publish official rate limits for its public, undocumented API endpoints that `yfinance` and similar tools use. This is a key characteristic of unofficial APIs â€“ they are not contractually guaranteed.

- **Observed Rate Limiting:** Users of `yfinance` and direct API calls have reported experiencing temporary bans or throttling (e.g., HTTP 401, 403, 429 errors, or `requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: ... yfinance failed to decrypt Yahoo data`) if they make too many requests in a short period from a single IP address.

  - The exact thresholds are not fixed and can vary. Some community estimates suggest limits like:
    - Around 2,000 requests per hour per IP.
    - No more than 5 requests per second.
  - These are anecdotal and can change without notice by Yahoo.

- **No Direct Costs for Basic Usage:** The Yahoo Finance API, when accessed via these public endpoints, is free of charge. There are no subscription fees or per-call charges for the data itself.

- **Consequences of Exceeding Limits:**

  - Temporary IP bans (ranging from minutes to hours, or even longer if abuse is suspected).
  - Inconsistent data retrieval (failed requests).

- **`yfinance` Library Behavior:**
  - The `yfinance` library itself does not inherently bypass these rate limits. It simply provides a convenient way to access the known endpoints.
  - Some versions or forks might include basic retry mechanisms or slight delays, but sophisticated rate limit management is generally outside its core scope.
  - The library has faced periods where Yahoo changed its API, requiring updates to `yfinance` to restore functionality. This highlights the risk of relying on an unofficial API.

**Considerations for Trade-Pro:**

- **High Risk for Production System:** Relying solely on an unofficial API with unknown and variable rate limits is a significant risk for a platform aiming for reliability, as outlined in the PRD (uptime requirements, etc.).
- **Impact on Data Fetching:**
  - Initial bulk historical data downloads for many symbols could trigger rate limits.
  - Frequent updates for real-time/near real-time price ticking for multiple active users and a wide range of instruments could easily exceed limits.
- **Mitigation Strategies (if proceeding with Yahoo Finance Free API):**

  - **Caching:** Aggressively cache API responses. Store historical data locally after the first fetch. Cache recent price data with appropriate TTLs (Time To Live).
  - **Request Throttling/Queuing:** Implement a request scheduler on the backend to spread out API calls over time, staying well below suspected limits.
  - **Delayed Updates:** For less critical data or background updates, use longer intervals.
  - **User-Specific Data:** Fetch data on demand when a user views a specific asset, rather than trying to keep everything updated constantly for all possible assets.
  - **Error Handling & Retries:** Implement robust error handling with exponential backoff for retries when rate limit errors (like 429) are detected.
  - **Proxy/IP Rotation (Complex & Potentially Against ToS):** While some might consider using proxies to distribute requests across multiple IPs, this adds complexity and might violate Yahoo's Terms of Service.
  - **User Load Simulation:** The PRD mentions up to 1000 concurrent users. If each user action triggers multiple API calls (e.g., loading charts, watchlists), the backend needs to be very intelligent about data reuse and minimizing direct Yahoo API calls.

- **Alternative/Backup Data Sources:** Given the risks, the PRD's requirement for a single data source (Yahoo Finance) should be revisited. Having a plan B or a commercial data provider as a fallback or for critical real-time components might be necessary for a production-grade system.

**Next Steps for this point:**

- Quantify the expected number of API calls based on PRD features (e.g., number of assets to track, update frequency for charts, number of concurrent users, historical data needs).
- Design a robust caching and request management layer within Trade-Pro's backend to minimize direct API calls to Yahoo Finance.
- Re-evaluate the PRD's stance on relying solely on a free, unofficial API for core market data, given these rate limiting and reliability concerns. Discuss potential for a paid/official API if budget allows and reliability is paramount.

## 4. Real-time Data Capabilities and Update Frequency

**Objective:** Determine how "real-time" the data from Yahoo Finance is, its update frequency, and whether it meets the PRD's requirements for real-time price updates and charting.

**Findings (Based on general knowledge, `yfinance` community discussions, and API behavior):**

- **Not Truly Real-Time (Streaming):**

  - The standard Yahoo Finance API (accessed by `yfinance` for historical and quote data) is **not a streaming API**. It provides snapshot data through polling (request/response).
  - To get updated prices, you need to make a new API request for the specific ticker(s).

- **Data Freshness/Delay:**

  - **Quotes for Actively Traded Markets (e.g., US stocks during market hours):** Data is often delayed, typically by 15-20 minutes for some exchanges (e.g., NYSE, NASDAQ) as per their terms. Some data might be closer to real-time or have shorter delays (e.g., a few minutes or less), especially for certain markets or indices. It varies significantly.
  - **Forex and Cryptocurrencies:** These markets trade 24/7. Data freshness can also vary. Crypto data might be relatively up-to-date from major sources Yahoo aggregates, while Forex might have delays similar to equity markets depending on the source Yahoo uses.
  - **International Markets:** Delays can differ based on the specific exchange and its agreement with Yahoo Finance for data redistribution.
  - **Pre-market and After-hours Data:** Yahoo Finance does show pre-market and after-hours data, but its update frequency and delay can also be variable and generally not as rapid as during main trading sessions.

- **Update Frequency via Polling:**

  - Since it's a polling-based API, the "update frequency" for Trade-Pro would be determined by how often the application's backend polls Yahoo Finance for new data.
  - Frequent polling (e.g., every few seconds for many instruments) would quickly run into the rate limits discussed in the previous section.

- **`yfinance` for Quotes:**

  - The `ticker.info` attribute or specific quote-fetching functions in `yfinance` can retrieve current market data (last price, bid, ask, volume, etc.).
  - This is still a snapshot and subject to the underlying delays from Yahoo Finance.

- **PRD Implications ("Real-time updates from Yahoo", "Real-time Portfolio Metrics"):**
  - The PRD mentions "real-time updates from Yahoo" for charts and "Real-time Portfolio Metrics." True, tick-by-tick real-time data is unlikely with the free Yahoo Finance API.
  - The platform will provide **near real-time** or **delayed real-time** data at best, with the freshness depending on polling frequency and Yahoo's own data aggregation delays.
  - This needs to be clearly communicated to users (e.g., "Prices delayed by X minutes").

**Considerations for Trade-Pro:**

- **User Expectations:** If users expect a true real-time trading experience comparable to professional brokerage platforms, the free Yahoo Finance API will not meet these expectations due to data delays and the polling nature.
- **Charting:** Charts will update based on how frequently new data points are fetched and plotted. For active intraday charts, this could mean polling every minute or few minutes, which needs to be balanced against rate limits.
- **Portfolio Valuation:** Real-time portfolio metrics will be based on the latest (potentially delayed) prices fetched from the API.
- **Order Execution Simulation:** The simulation of order execution should account for the fact that the prices used for matching might be delayed. This is acceptable for a simulated environment but needs to be understood.
- **WebSockets (PRD 4.4):** The PRD mentions WebSocket usage for real-time data flow. While the Trade-Pro _client_ can use WebSockets to receive updates from the Trade-Pro _backend_, the backend itself will be polling Yahoo Finance. The backend can then push these polled updates to clients via WebSockets. There isn't a direct WebSocket stream from Yahoo Finance's free tier.

**Next Steps for this point:**

- Clarify the PRD's definition of "real-time." If true, low-latency, streaming data is a hard requirement, Yahoo Finance's free API is not suitable, and alternative (likely paid) data sources are necessary.
- Design the backend polling strategy: determine a sustainable polling frequency for different asset types or user activity levels, considering rate limits.
- Implement clear disclaimers in the UI regarding data delays.
- For the WebSocket architecture, ensure it's designed for the backend to push updates efficiently to clients after polling the data source.

## 5. Specific Data Points Available Beyond OHLCV

**Objective:** Identify the range of specific data points available from Yahoo Finance (via `yfinance` or direct calls) beyond basic Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume, and map them to PRD requirements (e.g., bid/ask, 52-week H/L, market cap, P/E, EPS, news, etc.).

**Findings (Based on `yfinance` Ticker object attributes and general Yahoo Finance capabilities):**

The `yfinance` library, through its `Ticker` object (e.g., `ticker = yf.Ticker("MSFT")`), provides access to a rich set of information via the `ticker.info` dictionary and other methods. This data is scraped from various Yahoo Finance pages.

**Key Data Points Potentially Available (Availability can vary by asset type and specific symbol):**

- **Quote Data (often found in `ticker.info` or quote-specific endpoints):**

  - `ask`, `askSize`
  - `bid`, `bidSize`
  - `lastPrice` / `currentPrice` (may be called `regularMarketPrice`, `currentPrice` etc.)
  - `open`, `previousClose`, `dayHigh`, `dayLow`
  - `volume`, `averageVolume`, `averageVolume10days`
  - `marketCap`
  - `exchange`, `quoteType` (e.g., EQUITY, INDEX, CURRENCY, FUTURE, CRYPTO)
  - `currency`
  - `shortName`, `longName`

- **Price Data & Ranges:**

  - `fiftyTwoWeekHigh`, `fiftyTwoWeekLow`
  - `fiftyDayAverage`, `twoHundredDayAverage`

- **Fundamental Data (primarily for Equities):**

  - `trailingPE`, `forwardPE` (Price-to-Earnings ratio)
  - `trailingEps`, `forwardEps` (Earnings Per Share)
  - `pegRatio` (Price/Earnings to Growth ratio)
  - `priceToBook`
  - `priceToSalesTrailing12Months`
  - `enterpriseValue`, `enterpriseToRevenue`, `enterpriseToEbitda`
  - `bookValue`
  - `dividendRate`, `dividendYield`, `exDividendDate`, `lastDividendValue`, `lastDividendDate`
  - `payoutRatio`
  - `sharesOutstanding`, `floatShares`
  - `beta` (market volatility)

- **Financial Statements (via `ticker.financials`, `ticker.balance_sheet`, `ticker.cashflow` - often annually and quarterly for equities):**

  - Income Statement: `Total Revenue`, `Net Income`, `EBITDA`, etc.
  - Balance Sheet: `Total Assets`, `Total Liabilities`, `Shareholder Equity`, etc.
  - Cash Flow Statement: `Operating Cash Flow`, `Capital Expenditures`, etc.

- **Company Information (primarily for Equities, in `ticker.info`):**

  - `sector`, `industry`
  - `fullTimeEmployees`
  - `longBusinessSummary`
  - `website`, `address`, `city`, `country`

- **Market Hours & Trading Information:**

  - `marketState` (e.g., REGULAR, PRE, POST, CLOSED)
  - `regularMarketOpen`, `regularMarketPreviousClose`, `regularMarketDayHigh`, `regularMarketDayLow`
  - `preMarketPrice`, `preMarketChange`
  - `postMarketPrice`, `postMarketChange`

- **News (via `ticker.news`):**

  - Provides a list of recent news articles related to the ticker, often with links, publisher, and publication timestamp.
  - The PRD (3.6.1 Dashboard Design) requires a "News Feed" widget.

- **Options Data (via `ticker.options`, `ticker.option_chain('YYYY-MM-DD')`):**

  - For assets with options markets, can fetch option chains (calls and puts, strike prices, bid, ask, volume, implied volatility, etc.).
  - The PRD does not explicitly mention options trading, but this data is available.

- **Analyst Recommendations (via `ticker.recommendations`):**
  - Summary of analyst ratings (e.g., buy, hold, sell) and price targets, if available.

**PRD Mapping & Considerations for Trade-Pro:**

- **Bid/Ask Spread Simulation (PRD 3.3.1):** Yahoo Finance provides `bid` and `ask` prices. This can be used as a basis for the platform's spread simulation, but the PRD also requires dynamic spread adjustments (volatility, market hours, news impact), which would be logic built on top of this raw data.
- **Data Points per Asset (PRD 3.3.1):** The PRD lists requirements like "Daily High/Low, Opening Price, Previous Close, 52-Week High/Low, Market Capitalization, P/E Ratio, EPS, Dividend Yield, Volume." Most of these are directly available.
- **News Feed (PRD 3.6.1):** The `ticker.news` functionality seems to directly support this.
- **Market Depth (L2) (PRD 3.6.2):** Yahoo Finance API (and `yfinance`) does **not** typically provide Level 2 market data (detailed order book). This is usually a premium feature from specialized data providers. If L2 data is a hard requirement, Yahoo Finance is not sufficient.
- **Data Availability Varies:** It's crucial to remember that not all data points are available for all asset types. Fundamental data is rich for equities but sparse for forex or commodities. Even for equities, data availability depends on the company and market.
- **Consistency and Accuracy:** As the data is scraped, there can occasionally be inconsistencies or missing fields. Robust error handling and data validation will be needed in Trade-Pro.

**Next Steps for this point:**

- Create a detailed mapping of PRD-required data points against what Yahoo Finance typically provides for each relevant asset class (Stocks, Forex, Crypto, Commodities, Indices).
- Specifically confirm the absence of Level 2 market data and discuss its impact on the "Market Depth (L2)" feature mentioned in PRD 3.6.2. If critical, an alternative source for L2 data would be needed.
- Plan how to handle missing data points gracefully in the UI.

## 6. Data Quality and Reliability

**Objective:** Evaluate the general perception of Yahoo Finance data quality and reliability, especially when accessed via unofficial means like the `yfinance` library, and consider implications for a simulated trading platform.

**Findings (Based on community feedback, `yfinance` issues, and general understanding of free data sources):**

- **General Perception:**

  - For a free service, Yahoo Finance data is widely used and generally considered to be reasonably accurate for retail investors, charting, and general market analysis, especially for end-of-day data and quotes on major, liquid instruments.
  - It aggregates data from various sources, and the quality can depend on these underlying sources.

- **Potential Issues and Inaccuracies:**

  - **Delays:** As discussed (Point 4), data is often delayed, which isn't a "quality" issue per se, but impacts its suitability for real-time applications.
  - **Errors in Data:** Occasional errors or inaccuracies in historical data (e.g., incorrect splits, missing dividends affecting adjusted prices, erroneous OHLCV points) have been reported by users over the years. These are more likely for less liquid stocks or less common markets.
  - **Gaps in Data:** Sometimes, historical data might have gaps (missing days or periods).
  - **Fundamental Data Discrepancies:** Fundamental data points (P/E, EPS, market cap) can sometimes differ from other financial data providers due to different calculation methodologies or update cycles.
  - **API Changes Breaking `yfinance`:** The `yfinance` library relies on scraping Yahoo Finance webpages and undocumented API endpoints. When Yahoo changes its website structure or API behavior, `yfinance` can break until the library maintainers release a fix. This has happened multiple times and represents a significant reliability risk for any application depending on it.
  - **No Guarantees or SLAs:** Being a free, unofficial service, there are no Service Level Agreements (SLAs) guaranteeing uptime, data accuracy, or availability. Yahoo can change or restrict access at any time without notice.

- **Suitability for Simulation:**

  - For a **simulated trading platform** where real money is not at stake, the data quality from Yahoo Finance is often considered acceptable, provided users are aware of potential delays and occasional inaccuracies.
  - The primary goal is to simulate market mechanics and trading logic, which can still be achieved even with minor data imperfections.
  - However, if the simulation aims to be extremely precise or used for academic research relying on perfect data, its limitations should be acknowledged.

- **`yfinance` Library Maintenance:**
  - The reliability of data access through `yfinance` is heavily dependent on the library's maintenance and how quickly it adapts to changes made by Yahoo.
  - While `yfinance` is a popular and generally well-maintained open-source project, there can be lags between Yahoo making a breaking change and `yfinance` being updated.

**Considerations for Trade-Pro:**

- **Risk Management:** The biggest reliability risk is the dependency on an unofficial API that can change or become unavailable. This needs to be a key consideration in the project's risk assessment.
- **Data Validation/Cross-Referencing (Optional, Adds Complexity):** For critical data, one might consider cross-referencing with another free source if discrepancies are suspected, but this adds significant complexity.
- **Error Handling & Logging:** Robust error handling for API request failures, data parsing issues, or unexpected data formats is crucial. Logging these issues can help identify patterns or problems with the data feed.
- **User Disclaimers:** Clear disclaimers in the Trade-Pro platform about the source of the data, its potential for delays or inaccuracies, and the fact that it's for simulation purposes only are essential.
- **Impact of Inaccuracies on Simulation:** While minor inaccuracies might be tolerable, significant errors (e.g., a stock price being off by a large margin) could lead to a poor user experience or unrealistic simulation outcomes. The extent of this risk is hard to quantify without extensive testing.

**Next Steps for this point:**

- During development and testing, pay close attention to data fetched for various asset classes and compare it with other reputable sources periodically to spot-check for glaring inaccuracies.
- Develop a strategy for handling periods when `yfinance` might be broken due to Yahoo API changes (e.g., displaying a maintenance message, temporarily disabling certain features).
- Incorporate clear disclaimers about data source and quality into the Trade-Pro UI and terms of service, as per PRD section 6.2 (Financial Simulation Compliance).

## 7. Summary of Findings: Yahoo Finance API for Trade-Pro

This investigation assessed the Yahoo Finance API (with `yfinance` as a primary interface) against Trade-Pro's PRD requirements. Key findings are:

1. **Asset Coverage (PRD Alignment: Partial to Good):**

   - **Strengths:** Good coverage for Stocks, Indices, Forex, Cryptocurrencies (majors), Commodities (futures), ETFs, and Mutual Funds.
   - **Gaps/Concerns:** Does not provide direct CFD pricing (simulation needed). Depth for some niche assets may vary. Symbol conventions need careful mapping.

2. **Historical Data (PRD Alignment: Partial to Good):**

   - **Strengths:** Meets 5-year daily/weekly/monthly OHLCV requirement for most assets.
   - **Gaps/Concerns:** Significant limitation in historical depth for _intraday_ data (e.g., 1-min data only for ~7-30 days). If PRD needs long-term intraday history, this is a major gap.

3. **API Rate Limits & Costs (PRD Alignment: Poor - High Risk):**

   - **Strengths:** Free of charge.
   - **Gaps/Concerns:** No official/published rate limits. Relies on unofficial API endpoints. Users report temporary IP bans (e.g., ~2000 requests/hour/IP, <5/sec are anecdotal). This is a **major reliability risk** for a production system, especially with up to 1000 concurrent users. Aggressive caching and request throttling are mandatory but may not be foolproof.

4. **Real-time Capabilities (PRD Alignment: Poor to Fair):**

   - **Strengths:** Provides frequently updated snapshot data for many assets.
   - **Gaps/Concerns:** Not true real-time streaming. Data is often delayed (15-20 mins for some exchanges, varies for others). "Real-time" in PRD will be near real-time/delayed. Polling frequency is limited by rate limits. User expectations must be managed.

5. **Specific Data Points (PRD Alignment: Good, with one key exception):**

   - **Strengths:** Rich data available (bid/ask, 52-week H/L, market cap, P/E, EPS, dividends, news, fundamentals for equities, etc.), aligning with most PRD needs.
   - **Gaps/Concerns:** **No Level 2 (Market Depth) data.** This is a critical gap if the PRD's "Market Depth (L2)" feature is essential. Availability of all points varies by asset type.

6. **Data Quality & Reliability (PRD Alignment: Fair - Medium to High Risk):**
   - **Strengths:** Generally acceptable for simulation and retail use, especially end-of-day data.
   - **Gaps/Concerns:** Occasional inaccuracies, gaps, or fundamental data discrepancies. **High reliability risk** due to `yfinance` depending on unofficial APIs/scraping, which can break when Yahoo changes its site. No SLAs. Clear disclaimers are essential.

**Overall Suitability Assessment:**

- **For a free data source, Yahoo Finance (via `yfinance`) offers broad asset coverage and a wealth of data points.**
- **However, its reliance on unofficial APIs, lack of guaranteed uptime, potential rate limiting, data delays, and absence of Level 2 data pose significant risks and limitations when measured against the requirements of a robust, reliable trading platform as envisioned in the PRD.**
- **Critical Gaps to Address/Clarify from PRD:**
  - The true requirement for **Level 2 Market Depth data**.
  - The true requirement for **long-term historical intraday data** (beyond a few months).
  - The acceptable level of **data delay** for "real-time" features.
  - The project's risk tolerance for **API unreliability and potential service disruptions** due to changes by Yahoo.

Proceeding with Yahoo Finance as the sole data source requires accepting these risks and investing heavily in mitigation strategies (caching, throttling, error handling, user disclaimers). A commercial data provider would mitigate many of these issues but incur costs.

## 8. Migration Plan to `yfinance` (Adhering to Current PRD)

This plan outlines the steps to migrate the Trade-Pro project's market data fetching capabilities to exclusively use the Yahoo Finance API via the `yfinance` Python library. This aligns with the current PRD (Section 3.3.1) which specifies Yahoo Finance as the data source. This plan also incorporates crucial mitigation strategies to address the inherent risks (unreliability, rate limits, data delays, no L2 data) associated with using this unofficial API.

**Assumptions:**

- The PRD will be reviewed for potential amendments regarding real-time expectations, L2 data, and risk acknowledgment, but this initial migration proceeds with the current PRD text.
- The backend is capable of running Python scripts or services (e.g., via Supabase Edge Functions if they support Python, or a separate Python backend service/microservice).

### Phase 1: Setup and Initial Integration (1-2 Weeks)

1. **Environment Setup:**

   - **Action:** Ensure Python environment is set up in the backend development/deployment environment.
   - **Action:** Add `yfinance` to the project's Python dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt`).
   - **Tooling:** `pip install yfinance`

2. **Core Data Fetching Service Development:**

   - **Action:** Design and implement a centralized backend service/module (`MarketDataService_YFinance`) responsible for all interactions with `yfinance`.
   - **Action:** This service will encapsulate `yfinance` calls and include basic error handling (try-except blocks for network issues, `yfinance` specific errors).
   - **Key Functions to Implement initially:**
     - `get_historical_data(symbol, start_date, end_date, interval)`: For OHLCV data.
     - `get_current_quote(symbol)`: For latest price, bid, ask, volume, day's high/low, previous close.
     - `get_instrument_info(symbol)`: For fetching fundamental data, company info, 52-week H/L, etc. (maps to `ticker.info`).
     - `get_news(symbol)`: For fetching recent news articles.

3. **Symbol Mapping:**

   - **Action:** Create a robust mapping utility to convert Trade-Pro's internal asset symbols (including the provided CFD-style symbols for indices and commodities) to the ticker symbols recognized by Yahoo Finance (e.g., `US500` -> `^GSPC`, `XAU/USD` -> `GC=F` or `XAUUSD=X`).
   - **Action:** Store these mappings in a configurable way (e.g., a JSON file or database table).

4. **Basic Caching Layer (In-Memory or Simple File-Based for now):**

   - **Action:** Implement an initial, simple caching mechanism within `MarketDataService_YFinance` to store results of `yfinance` calls for a short duration (e.g., 1-5 minutes for quotes, longer for historical data or info that changes less frequently).
   - **Rationale:** Immediate step to reduce redundant API calls even during development.

5. **Replace Existing Data Hooks/Services (Identify and Prioritize):**
   - **Action:** Identify all current code sections using Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, or Polygon.io (as mentioned in the original Gap Assessment - `useMarketData.ts` etc.).
   - **Action:** Prioritize replacing data fetching for a few key areas first (e.g., displaying stock prices on a watchlist, showing a basic chart for a single stock) to use the new `MarketDataService_YFinance`.

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Data Integration & Advanced Mitigation (3-4 Weeks)

1. **Full Asset Class Integration:**

   - **Action:** Systematically update all parts of the application (charts, portfolio valuation, trading interface, analytics) to use `MarketDataService_YFinance` for all asset classes (Stocks, Indices, Commodities, Forex, Crypto) as per the defined symbol mappings.
   - **Action:** Ensure all PRD-required data points (where available from Yahoo) are fetched and displayed.

2. **Robust Caching System:**

   - **Action:** Design and implement a more sophisticated caching solution (e.g., Redis, Memcached, or Supabase database caching if suitable).
   - **Action:** Define appropriate cache TTLs (Time-To-Live) for different data types (e.g., quotes: 1-15 mins depending on market activity/delay acceptance; historical data: 24 hours; instrument info: daily or weekly).
   - **Action:** Implement cache invalidation strategies where necessary.

3. **Request Throttling and Queuing Mechanism:**

   - **Action:** Implement a request scheduler/manager in the backend to control the rate of outgoing calls to `yfinance`.
   - **Action:** Enforce limits (e.g., configurable max requests per second/minute) to stay well below suspected Yahoo Finance rate limits (e.g., aim for <1 request per second on average, burst carefully).
   - **Action:** Implement a queue for pending requests if the rate limit is approached.

4. **Advanced Error Handling and Retry Logic:**

   - **Action:** Enhance error handling in `MarketDataService_YFinance` to specifically identify potential rate limit errors (e.g., HTTP 429, 403, or specific `yfinance` exceptions indicating data fetch failures).
   - **Action:** Implement exponential backoff and retry mechanisms for transient errors or suspected rate limiting.
   - **Action:** Log all API errors and retry attempts for monitoring.

5. **Configuration Management:**

   - **Action:** Make API call parameters, cache settings, rate limits, and retry logic configurable (e.g., via environment variables or a configuration file).

6. **Historical Data Backfilling Strategy (Optional, if needed beyond `yfinance` limits):**
   - **Action:** If longer intraday history is absolutely critical (and PRD isn't changed), investigate strategies for _gradually_ collecting and storing intraday data over time. This is complex and may not be fully achievable due to `yfinance` limitations on deep intraday history.
   - **Focus:** Primarily rely on daily data for long-term history as it's more robustly available via `yfinance`.

### Phase 3: Testing, Optimization, and Documentation (2-3 Weeks)

1. **Thorough Testing:**

   - **Action:** Test data fetching for all asset classes and symbols on the PRD list.
   - **Action:** Verify data accuracy against Yahoo Finance website itself (spot checks).
   - **Action:** Test error handling, caching, and rate limiting mechanisms under simulated load (where possible without actually spamming Yahoo).

2. **Performance Optimization:**

   - **Action:** Optimize frontend and backend data handling to minimize unnecessary requests and efficiently use cached data.
   - **Action:** Analyze response times for data display.

3. **User Disclaimers and UI Updates:**

   - **Action:** Implement clear UI disclaimers regarding data source (Yahoo Finance), potential delays (e.g., "Data delayed by up to 15-20 minutes"), and that the platform is for simulation purposes only.
   - **Action:** Ensure UI gracefully handles situations where data might be temporarily unavailable.

4. **Monitoring and Alerting (Basic):**

   - **Action:** Set up basic logging and monitoring for the health of `MarketDataService_YFinance`, focusing on API error rates and cache performance.
   - **Action:** Consider alerts for high failure rates, which might indicate `yfinance` library issues or Yahoo API changes.

5. **Documentation:**
   - **Action:** Document the `MarketDataService_YFinance` architecture, caching strategy, rate limiting approach, and known limitations.
   - **Action:** Update any relevant sections of the project's technical documentation.
   - **Action:** Prepare a list of PRD sections that are impacted by the limitations of Yahoo Finance (e.g., real-time definition, L2 data, intraday history depth) for discussion with stakeholders.

### Contingency Planning

- **`yfinance` Breakage:** Be prepared for `yfinance` to break if Yahoo changes its website/API. Monitor the `yfinance` library's GitHub repository for issues and updates. Have a plan for how the application will behave if data becomes unavailable (e.g., display cached data with warnings, temporarily disable trading features).
- **Persistent Rate Limiting/Blocking:** If the application consistently gets blocked by Yahoo despite mitigation efforts, this will necessitate an urgent re-evaluation of the data source strategy (i.e., moving to a paid provider sooner than planned).

This migration plan focuses on fulfilling the current PRD requirement while building in necessary safeguards. The emphasis throughout should be on minimizing direct calls to Yahoo Finance and managing the associated risks.
