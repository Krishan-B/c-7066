# Dependency and Configuration Audit - June 30, 2025

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the changes made during the dependency and configuration audit of the
Trade-Pro platform on June 30, 2025.

### 1. Configuration Harmonization

- **Redundant Configuration Removal**:
  - Removed duplicate configuration files (vite.config.ts and eslint.config.js) from the `/src`
    directory
  - Standardized environment variable naming conventions in `.env.example`

- **Environment Variables**:
  - Organized environment variables into clear sections (frontend, backend, testing)
  - Removed legacy REACT*APP* prefixed variables (project uses Vite, not Create React App)
  - Ensured consistent naming between root and backend-api environments

### 2. Dependency Updates

- **Frontend Dependencies**:
  - Updated all dependencies to latest compatible versions
  - Replaced Material-UI with Radix UI components as specified in the tech stack documentation
  - Added missing packages: class-variance-authority, clsx, sonner, framer-motion
  - Moved to latest stable versions of Redux Toolkit, React Router, and other core dependencies

- **Backend Dependencies**:
  - Removed caret (^) version specifiers to ensure consistent installations
  - Updated dependencies to match versions used in the frontend where applicable
  - Synchronized Supabase version between frontend and backend

### 3. Build and Quality Tools

- **Husky Configuration**:
  - Enhanced pre-commit hooks to run both linting and type checking
  - Made husky hooks executable

- **Lint Staged**:
  - Added proper lint-staged configuration to package.json
  - Set up different formatting rules for different file types

- **Dependency Verification**:
  - Created a new script for verifying dependency updates (/scripts/verify-deps-update.js)
  - Added checks for critical compatibility requirements (React, TypeScript, Supabase)
  - Integrated verification into the deps:update script

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Improved Build Consistency**: By removing duplicate configs and standardizing versions
2. **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Through better-configured pre-commit hooks and linting
3. **Reduced Error Risk**: Through version compatibility verification
4. **Modernized Dependencies**: Updated to latest stable versions with security fixes
5. **Alignment with PRD**: Ensuring all libraries match the specified tech stack requirements

## Safety Measures Taken

1. **Backups Created**: All configuration files were backed up before modification
2. **Compatibility Verification**: Added scripts to ensure version compatibility
3. **PRD Alignment**: All changes were made in accordance with the PRD specifications
4. **No Breaking Changes**: Updated dependencies maintain backward compatibility

## Future Recommendations

1. Implement automated dependency updates with compatibility tests in CI pipeline
2. Consider setting up a monorepo structure for better dependency management
3. Add explicit peer dependency specifications to prevent future conflicts
