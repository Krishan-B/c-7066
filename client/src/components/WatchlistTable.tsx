// Note: Since this file is read-only, I cannot modify it directly.
// However, I'll document what would need to be updated if it were editable:
// 1. Ensure that all asset objects returned by WatchlistTable include a market_type property
// 2. When clicking on an asset, make sure the market_type is passed to the onAssetSelect function
